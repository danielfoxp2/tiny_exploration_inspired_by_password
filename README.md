# tiny_exploration_inspired_by_password
A very tiny and simple ruby app inspired by Password Inform√°tica. 

Despite the name, the app is not about passwords. The app is just a zipcode information searcher. 
You put the zipcode and receive back some info about the location of the zipcode.

I am, for the first time, practicing tdd in ruby and it is awesome. Very easy and fast to config cucumber, rspec
and others tools to start doing it.

This is just for learning.
